This Repository details the series of works on **Blockchain and Smart Contract Security** 

## Background 
Started to work on Smart Contract Security as part of the Blockchain Technology Course (20CY712 and 21CY712) and expanded the project to a large scale to cater to the need for Open-Source Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Tools.

#### Start Date: Nov 2021

## Aim
To understand, explore and detect Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts
